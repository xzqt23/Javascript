        /*
        Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
        calculated using the formula:
        BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
        and height in meter).
        Your tasks:
        1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
        2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
        versions)
        3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
        whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
        Test data:
        ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
        m tall.
        ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
        
        */
        const MarksWeight = 78
        const MarksHeight = 1.69
        const JohnsWeight = 92
        const JohnsHeight = 1.95
        const BMIMark = MarksWeight / MarksHeight ** 2
        const BMIJohn = JohnsWeight / JohnsHeight ** 2
        const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn


        console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn)
        console.log(markHigherBMI)
